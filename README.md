# E-Learning Resources
Below you'll find a few collated links for self-directed learning. You can start out with any one that catches your eye! Some of the tutorials below are language specific, and will be marked as such. Not all links are coding related, some are basic explanations to key buzzwords that like to be thrown about so that you'll be able to have at least a brief understanding.

## Intro to Programming
A lot of programming concepts are actually not unique to any one programming language. When going through these tutorials, keep in mind that your intention should not be to learn *Python* or *Javascript*, but rather, to learn how to program. There is a key difference and it will show. You can think of Python as simply a tool for your programming, an interface for you. What is more important is how you learn to approach problems and solve them, which to me is the essence of programming. When watching these tutorials, always keep in mind what are the **fundamentals** these tutorials are trying to teach you, and try not to miss the forest for the trees.

## Artificial Intelligence, *without* Machine Learning
Some people make this confusion and think that AI = ML; in reality, ML is a subset of AI. The links below provide a good example of this and hope to clear up any confusion.
